# UK Subsidies & The Referendum

This is a project aimed at collecting subsidies received by the United Kingdom under the European Structural Funds programme.

For now, the following programmes are collected:
* European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) 2007 - 2013
* European Social Funds (ESF) 2007 - 2013

The final aim of this project is to show the results of the 2016 UK referendum and the subsidies received on a map, where electoral wards and administrative regions are harmonized / properly aggregated.
